# 🚀 Linux Dev Setup Automation

Easily bootstrap your Ubuntu environment with a beautiful interactive menu and script automation. Install your favorite tools, set global aliases, and even uninstall them later — all with a single command.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Install apps with an interactive checklist menu
- 🌍 Option to make the setup globally accessible via the `setup` command
- 🧼 Uninstall any installed app from a similar interactive menu
- 🛠️ Scripts are modular and easy to extend (`apps/` folder)
- 🧙‍♂️ Custom aliases are linked automatically when using ZSH
- 🧾 All actions are logged in `install.log`

---

## ⚡ Quick install via curl (Ubuntu)

If you want to start with a minimal setup, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michelpl/linux-dev-setup/main/script.sh | bash
```

This script (`script.sh`) is compatible with Ubuntu, installs `git` and the GitHub CLI (`gh`), waits for GitHub login, creates `~/projects`, and clones `michelpl/linux-dev-setup` into `~/projects/linux-dev-setup`.

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michelpl/linux-dev-setup.git
cd linux-dev-setup/Ubuntu-24.04
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 2. Run the setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

You'll see a terminal menu where you can:

- Select which apps to install (e.g., Chrome, VSCode, Postman, etc.)
- Enable the **Global** option to run this script from anywhere as `setup`
- Choose to enter the **Uninstall** menu

### 3. (Optional) Run from anywhere

If you selected the `Global` option, you can now use:

```bash
setup        # opens the install menu
setup uninstall  # opens the uninstall menu
```

---

## 🔁 Uninstalling Apps

You can uninstall apps at any time:

```bash
setup uninstall
```

You’ll be presented with a checklist of all installed apps (with uninstall scripts) and the option to **remove the global `setup` command**.
