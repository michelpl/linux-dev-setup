Thank you for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Add a new app:**
   - Create an install script in `apps/` (e.g., `apps/mytool.sh`).
   - (Optional) Create a matching uninstall script in `apps/uninstall/` (e.g., `apps/uninstall/mytool-uninstall.sh`).
   - Your app will appear automatically in the setup and uninstall menus.
3. **Improve scripts or documentation:**
   - Feel free to refactor, fix bugs, or improve the README/docs.
4. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Guidelines

- Keep scripts modular and in English.
- Test your scripts on Ubuntu 24.04+.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- If your script requires extra dependencies, handle their installation in the script.
- For questions or suggestions, open an issue.

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
